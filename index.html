        <p>Hi there! My name is [Your Name], and I'm a passionate self-taught software engineer. Over the past two years, I've dedicated myself to learning web development, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Building small projects helped me understand these basics, and then I took my learning further by enrolling in a year-long bootcamp. There, I delved into advanced concepts and languages like React, Python, TypeScript, SQL, and some UI/UX design principles. The bootcamp was intense but rewarding, and it equipped me with the skills to build more complex projects, such as a Pong website where you can play against a bot that becomes faster over time, and a Discord bot that provides motivational quotes using Python.</p>
        <p>
            Most recently, I worked on a real-world project for a startup providing security guard services. They needed a professional website to showcase their business and attract clients. Using React, TypeScript, Supabase, SQL, and Tailwind CSS, I developed a home page with company information, a contact form for candidates, a section for interested companies, and a resume submission form. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skills. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, playing video games, and hanging out with friends. Looking forward to connecting and creating something awesome together!</p>
